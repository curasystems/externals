            A message digest, which is used by NAKACK for keeping track of current 
            seqnos for all members. It contains pairs of senders and a range of seqnos 
            (low and high), where each sender is associated with its highest and 
            lowest seqnos seen so far. That is, the lowest seqno which was not yet garbage-collected and the highest that was seen so far and is deliverable (or was already delivered) to the application. A range of [0 - 0] means no messages have been received yet. 
            <p>
            The highest <i>seen</i> sequence number is used to disseminate information about the last (highest) message M 
            received from a sender P. Since we might be using a negative acknowledgment 
            message numbering scheme, we would never know if the last message was lost. 
            Therefore we periodically gossip and include the last message seqno. Members 
            who haven't seen it (e.g. because msg was dropped) will request a 
            retransmission.
