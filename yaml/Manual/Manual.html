	<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		Dear Yaml fans,
	</p>
	<p>
		We are two computer science students from the
		<a href="http://www.uhasselt.be" title="University site">
		University of Hasselt</a>. In our second Bachelor year we
		had to implement a .NET <a href="http://www.yaml.org/"
		title="Homepage of the Yaml project">Yaml</a> parser as a
		project. The requirements of the project were to implement
		it in C# and release it as Open Source. Further we took
		also the challenge to make it a one pass parser.
	</p>
	<p>
		We will follow the project, but due of our busy student life
		we can't say at the moment that we will have time to do a
		lot of coding.
	</p>
	<p>
		We hope you enjoy our work and it is useful.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="lic">License</h2>
	<p>
		We released our software as an OpenSource project. This is one
		of the project requirements and also has our full support.
		We used the GNU General Public License that can be found in <kbd>COPYING</kbd>
		file placed in the <kbd>Code</kbd> directory. More information
		can be found on 
		<a href="http://www.gnu.org/" title="GNU General Public License">
		http://www.gnu.org/</a>.
	</p>

	<h2 id="support">Currently supported</h2>

	<p>
		Yaml is a very extensive markup/serialisation language.
		There are a lot of parsers available over the net, and not
		all of them support all possible structures defined in the
		official documentation. We had very few time while developing
		this parser and so we were far from able to complete
		everything. We also didn't aim to complete everything because
		there are discussions going on about simplifying the Yaml
		language definition and moving to JSON compatibility.
		We stayed close to the core without going too
		much in detail. As a result of using an object oriented
		language, our parser is very well structured and easy to
		extend.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is a list of the currently supported features.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Sequences</li>
		<li>Explicit mappings</li>
		<li>Implicit mappings (without leading colon) (still unstable)</li>
		<li>Inline mappings and sequences</li>
		<li>Nesting of all kind of supported structures except
			some nestings inside inline mappings or sequences</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Strings</li>
		<li>Folded and block scalars (but no + and - chomps)</li>
		<li>Booleans</li>
		<li>Null values</li>
		<li>Integers</li>
		<li>Floats</li>
		<li>Timestamps</li>
		<li>Binary</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		This has yet to come.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Multiple Yaml documents in a single file</li>
		<li>Anchors and references</li>
		<li>Indexers for mappings. But in a way it can be used just like
				a hashtable</li>
		<li>Some bug fixes</li>
		<li>...</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2 id="getit">Get the source</h2>
	
	<p>
		We use CVS to manage our code. You can check out with an anonymous account at this place:
		<kbd>:pserver:anonymous@lumumba.uhasselt.be:/home/christophe/Pro2 
		in the <q>yaml</q> repository</kbd>.
		At this time there are some junk files like our analyse and end report for the 
		educational team (this is in dutch).
		Some files of interest are the Linux/Unix Makefile and the Visual Studio project files.
		Jonathan is a Linux developer/user and Christophe likes Windows. This is the reason that
		our library works fine on the two platforms.
	</p>

	<h2 id="compile">Compiling this library</h2>

		<h3 id="prepro">Preprocessor definition</h3>
		<p>
			We use preprocessor defines for easily enabling
			or disabling support for certain datatypes.
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>General</dt>
			<dd><ul>
				<li>UNSTABLE (Also enable unstable code, more features)</li>
			</ul></dd>
			<dt>Node.cs</dt>
			<dd><ul>
				<li>SUPORT_EXPLICIT_TYPE</li>
				<li>SUPPORT_IMPLICIT_MAPPINGS (requires UNSTABLE)</li>
			</ul></dd>
			<dt>Scalar.cs</dt>
			<dd><ul>
				<li>SUPPORT_NULL_NODES</li>
				<li>SUPPORT_INTEGER_NODES</li>
				<li>SUPPORT_FLOAT_NODES</li>
				<li>SUPPORT_BOOLEAN_NODES</li>
				<li>SUPPORT_BINARY_NODES</li>
				<li>SUPPORT_TIMESTAMP_NODES</li>
			</ul></dd>
		</dl>
		<p>
			The precompiled DLL has everything enabled. Possibly in the future there
			comes a feature to enable/disable this at runtime. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This library can be compiled with the Microsoft C# .NET
			compiler and with Mono. We've choosen to use only the .NET 1.0 and not
			the new 2.0 version. This for extra compatibility with 
			<a href="http://www.mono-project.com/" title="Homepage of the Mono project">Mono</a>.
		</p>

		<h3 id="integrate">Integration in other projects</h3>
		
		<p>
			There are two options. You can put all the code in your project or use our library as 
			a DLL. You can find a debug and a release version in the folder <kbd>Code/bin/</kbd>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our project is also signed with a public key. You can found it in the same
			directory as the source code. We hope this will help for further development.
		</p>

	<h2 id="example">Code examples</h2>

		<p>
			You'll have to import the YAML namespace in order to
			use this classes. We leave it behind in the the following
			code examples.
		</p>
		
<pre class="cs">
using Yaml;
</pre>
		
		<p>
			If you are using Visual Studio, then you also need to
			refer to the folder where the Yaml DLL is placed.
			In the provided examples is referred to the Debug DLL found in
			<kbd>Code/bin/Debug/</kbd>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Note: all this code examples and more can be found in the <kbd>Examples</kbd>
		folder.
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="readfile">Reading YAML from a file</h3>
		
<pre class="cs">
Node node = Node.FromFile ("testRead.yaml");
Console.WriteLine (node);
</pre>
		<p>
			Note: 'Node.ToString ()' does not return YAML code.
			Use 'Node.Write ()' instead.
		</p>

		<h3 id="readstring">Reading YAML from a string</h3>
<pre class="cs">
Node node = Node.Parse ("- item1\n- item2\n");
Console.WriteLine (node);
</pre>

		<p>The output looks like this:</p>
<pre class="output">
[SEQUENCE][STRING]item1[/STRING][STRING]item2[/STRING][/SEQUENCE]
</pre>
		<h3 id="writefile">Writing YAML to a file</h3>

<pre class="cs">
Node node = Node.Parse ("- item1\n- item2\n");
node.ToFile ("testWrite.yaml");
</pre>
		<h3 id="writestring">Writing YAML to a string</h3>

<pre class="cs">
Node node = Node.Parse ("- item1\n- item2\n");
string s = node.Write ();
Console.WriteLine( s );
</pre>
		<p>The output looks like:</p>
<pre class="output">
- "item1"
- "item2"
</pre>
		<h3 id="createtree">Creating a YAML tree</h3>
<pre class="cs">
Sequence sequence = new Sequence (

	new Node []
	{
		new Yaml.String ("item 1"),
		new Yaml.String ("item 2"),
		new Yaml.String ("item 3"),

		new Mapping (
			new MappingNode []
			{
				new MappingNode (new Yaml.String ("key 2"), new Yaml.String ("value 1")),
				new MappingNode (new Yaml.String ("key 2"), new Yaml.String ("value 2"))
			} ),

		new Yaml.String ("item 5")
	} );

Console.WriteLine (sequence);
</pre>
<p>The output:</p>
		<p>
			Node, Sequence, Mapping, MappingNode and String are all
			members of the Yaml namespace. We recommand using
			Yaml.Node, ... Yaml.String to avoid conflicts with other
			namespaces.<br/>
			If you are using the System namespace at the sametime, 
			then there is a name collision with String. Use Yaml.String to 
			solve this.
		</p>

		<h3 id="traversetree">Browse a YAML tree</h3>
<pre class="cs">
foreach (Node s in sequence.Nodes)
{
	if (s.Type == NodeType.String)
		Console.Write ("Found a string: " + ((String) s).Content + "\n");
}
</pre>
<pre class="output">
Found a string: item 1
Found a string: item 2
Found a string: item 3
Found a string: item 5
</pre>

	<h2 id="algo">Description of our algorithms</h2>

	<p>
		We didn't copy any algorithm from an existing parser. The main
		reason for doing so is because the Syck parser is written in C while 
		we took a more object oriented approach. Other reasons include
		that not all the available parsers give the same parse result.
		Also, because it was a school project and we had to learn from
		this project, it had no sense to simply translate an existing
		parser to C#.
	</p>

	<h3 id="levels">Levels in our parser</h3>

	<p>
		Description of what we call the 'ParseStream'. See
		'ParseStream.cs'.
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Preprocessor</li>
		<li>Indentation processor</li>
		<li>Buffer</li>
		<li>Multilevel buffer (nested buffer)</li>
		<li>Comment remover</li>
		<li>The-last-new-line dropper</li>
		<li>Inline processor (StopAt char x)</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The preprocessor's job is mainly to remember the
		current line number. The line number is only used
		to throw ParseException which contain only the line
		where something went wrong.
	</p>
	<p>
		We're using here recursion. We have some kind of
		indentation processor which makes it possible for a
		nested YAML element to be parsed just like we would do
		at the root level, without having to care about its
		level of indentation or the way it appears.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our parser is almost 100% a one pass parser. We can read
		from a string but also from any kind of stream without
		ever having to look back before the current position.
		There are annoying YAML structures which require us
		to look back. For instance, mappings doesn't require
		to be preceded by a question mark, so actually we don't
		know when we start such an implicit mapping. The parser
		should do some kind of trial and error to guess the type
		of node we are parsing. We use a circular buffer of 1024
		just like described in the Yaml documentation to do some
		lookahead to guess and rewind if we were wrong. Implicit
		keys may not be longer then 1024, so the small size
		won't be any problem. Later on this buffer becomes also useful 
		while guessing the kind of scalar.
	</p>
	<p>
		While trying to parse an implicit mapping we may need to
		guess what type of scalar the key would be. This requires
		a buffer inside the buffer, this layer doesn't create a
		new buffer, but remembers the current position in the
		already existing buffer and uses a stack of start positions
		to restore the position while rewinding.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another layer removes the comments.
	</p>
	<p>
		The last newline of a block is never part of the node
		content, but is only necessary to start a new node. This
		newline will be dropped.
	</p>
	<p>
		Inline sequences and mappings don't depend on indentation.
		They start with an opening <q>{</q> or <q>[</q> and stop
		at the matching bracket. This layer adds a method to set
		the chars where the parser should stop parsing.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that we use corresponding methods. Each call
		for the indent method <strong>must</strong> go hand
		in hand with an unindent method. In the same way a call
		for a StopAt must be followed later on with calling
		the DontStop method.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most of this levels implement this methods:
	</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Next</dt>
			<dd>Move to the next character in the stream</dd>
		<dt>Char</dt>
			<dd>Return the current chararter</dd>
		<dt>EOF (end of file)</dt>
			<dd>True when we reached the end of the stream
			or substream</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>
		Each of the previously described layers derives from the
		previous layer and overrides the parents functions. Other
		parts of the parser only interact with the last layer.
	</p>

		<h4>More detailed description of the indentation processor</h4>
		<p>
			The indentation processor has two important public
			methods: 'Indent' and 'UnIndent'. Calling the first
			method implies that we are going into a childnode,
			probably more indented,
		</p>		
<pre class="yaml-code">
key:
  value
</pre>
		<p>
			but possibly the child is positioned directly after
			the parent node like in:
		</p>
<pre class="yaml-code">
key: value
</pre>
		<p>
			The indent function sets an indentation-request
			variable. When we continue moving through the stream
			and we meet a newline, the indentation processor
			checks how much the indentation is. If the indentation
			is more then the indentation of the previous line,
			than this line indeed belongs to the child node.
			Otherwise, this layer pretends that this is the end
			of the stream and set the EOF. Higher levels are fooled
			that the stream has ended until the UnIndent method has
			been called.

			When the indentation is more, we save the current level
	 		of indentation to be restored later on.

			Calling the UnIndent function will cancel the indentation
			request when we didn't meet a newline, otherwise we
			unpop the last indentation level from the stack.
		</p>

		<h4 id="buffer">More detailed description of the buffer</h4>
		<p>
			We use a circular buffer (like a queue) with a size of
			1k chars like described in the YAML documentation.
			Lookahead over more then 1024 characters is not possible,
			otherwise we could not call this a one-pass-parser. There
			are three important integer variables in the buffer class:
			rotation, position and size. Rotation points to the first
			cell of the buffer. Position is the offset of the current
			character in the buffer, so the actual position is
			<code>(rotation + position) % 1024</code>. Size is the
			length of the buffer part which is currently in use.
		</p>
		<p>
			When calling the BuildLookaheadBuffer method, the buffer
			will be initialized unless a build request has been done
			before. A DestroyBuffer call does not actually destroy the
			buffer, it only rotates the buffer. The current position
			becomes the rotation index and then it's set to zero. At
			that time only this layer knows that the buffer is still
			in use. Each Next call rotates the buffer more and more,
			until finally the buffer size becomes zero and it's really
			destroyed. This is necessary to allow destroying while not
			being at the end of the buffer. The Rewind call simply
			resets the position.
		</p>
		<p>
			Suppose that we build a buffer but a nested node requires
			us to do some lookahead again. This is possible, and
			therefore we have a stack (in the multilevelbuffer layer)
			which remembers all the start positions. Rewinding restores
			the stack peek. Destroying unpops the stack peek.
		</p>

		<h4 id="inlineprocessor">More detailed description of the inline processor</h4>
		<p>
			For instance, <q>{</q> indicates the start of an
			inline mapping. The parser should stop at a matching
			<q>}</q> or at a comma where a new item begins.
		</p>
<pre class="yaml">
[aaa, bbb, ccc, {ddd: eee, "f:ff": ggg}]
</pre>
		<p>
			A call of the StopAt method makes the inline processor
			stop at one of the given characters. We use a stack to
			override the 'parent' his behavior (e.g. in  nested
			inline mappings or sequences). Note that a call of StopAt
			can enlarge its character stream in contrast with Indent
			who only reduces its.
			The don't stop method cancels the StopAt behavior, and
			restores the last setting.
		</p>
		<p>
			We use this stop mechanism to parse mappings, inline
			sequences and quoted strings.
		</p>

	<h3 id="determinenode">Determining the type of node</h3>
		<h4>Explicit type indication</h4>
		<p>
			Nodes starting with a type indication (e.g: !!str) are
			easy to parse, they require no lookahead. At the moment
			we know that a node starts with two exclamation marks,
			we can be sure that a type indication follows. After
			reading the typename, we call the parse method for that
			specific kind of node.
		</p>
		<h4 id="gues">Guessing</h4>
		<p>
			When no type indication is given, we have to guess what
			kind of node follows. A hyphen (whether or not it must be
			followed by a space is still a heavy discussion, we don't
			require it at this time) or a opening square bracket is
			the start of a mapping. A question mark or opening curled
		       	bracket is the start of a mapping. Other types requires
			lookahead via a buffer.
		</p>
		<p>
			The next thing we try are inline mapping. We do an
			indentation request and set StopAt(colon), parse recursively
			the key and call DontStop and UnIndent. If the current
			character at that moment is a colon, then we're talking
			about an implicit mapping.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the node wasn't an inline mapping we try all the
			scalars one after one. The last scalar to try is a string.
		</p>
		
	<h3 id="parsescalar">Parsing of the scalars</h3>
	<p>
		Yaml is made to map data types on the build in language types. We made
		for each scalar an own wrapper class derived from Node.
		Further it is possible to represent scalars that are not jet supported, 
		for example the time zone of a timestamp. (This is not completely correct.
		A time zone is supported in .NET 2.0, but for compatibility reasons we only use .NET 1.0)	
	</p>
	<p>
		We also extend the normal number range. Integers are stored in a
		long type, so numbers from –9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 
		9,223,372,036,854,775,807 can be used.
	</p>
	<p>
		If there is a scalar expected then a ParseStream is given to the constructor 
		of the Scalar class. Here we require guessing like described in the
		previous section.  We used 
		<a href="http://yaml.org/type/index.html#id838503" title="Yaml scalar Types">http://yaml.org/type/</a> 
		as the reference. A important note is that there is not used the regular expression 
		for pattern matching because of it&acute;s lack of efficiency and the
		loss of being an one-pass parser.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="doc">Documentation</h2>
	
	<p>
		We used <a href="http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/" title="NDoc Code Documentation Generator for .NET">NDoc</a>
		for generating code documentation. It is based on the XML comment system of .NET 
		and gives the possibility to generate documentation in different formats.<br/>
	</p>
	<p>
		You can explore this documentation by using the menu on the left.
		In this documentation you can also find the private members of the classes.
		If you only want to use our parser, you may not need this. We leave it here,
		because it is useful for development and good understanding of the parser.<br/>

	<h2 id="vision">Our vision about YAML and its applications</h2>

	<p>
		Yaml is easy to read and understand. It's easy to write,
		but in our opinion users have too much freedom in choosing
		how they would write the same thing. This - what looks a
		rich set of data types and ways to write the same - results
		in more confusing rather then it helps. We agree with the
		YAML community that there's a need to simplify the language
		description.
	</p>
	<p>
		A big advantage of Yaml over XML is its support for anchors
		and references to this anchors. This supports not only
		tree-based data structures but also cyclic and acyclic
		data structures.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>
	
	<p> 
		Special thanks goes to the educational team (Tom Van Laerhoven and Jo Vermeulen). 
		Also we will thank Gert Van Gool and Ingo Berben who gives ous some good advice on
		C# programming. They were doing at the same time another C# project.
